Overview Diagram

1. Frontend: 
   - AWS Elastic Load Balancer (ELB): Distributes incoming traffic across multiple instances.
   - Amazon CloudFront: CDN for faster content delivery.

2. Application Layer:
   - Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling: Ensures the application can handle varying loads by automatically adjusting the number of EC2 instances.
   - AWS Lambda: For serverless functions that handle specific tasks like order matching.

3. Data Layer:
   - Amazon RDS: Managed relational database service for storing user data and transaction history.
   - Amazon DynamoDB: NoSQL database for high-speed data access, such as real-time trading data.

4. Caching:
   - Amazon ElastiCache: In-memory caching using Redis or Memcached to reduce database load and improve response times.

5. Messaging and Queueing:
   - Amazon SQS: For decoupling services and ensuring reliable message delivery.
   - Amazon SNS: For real-time notifications to users.

6. Monitoring and Logging:
   - Amazon CloudWatch: For monitoring the performance and health of the system.
   - AWS X-Ray: For tracing requests and identifying performance bottlenecks.

Elaboration on Cloud Services:
- AWS Elastic Load Balancer (ELB*: Ensures high availability by distributing traffic and providing fault tolerance. Alternative: Azure Load Balancer.
- Amazon CloudFront: Enhances user experience by caching content closer to users. Alternative: Google Cloud CDN.
- Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling: Automatically adjusts capacity to maintain steady performance. Alternative: Google Compute Engine Autoscaler.
- AWS Lambda: Executes code in response to events without provisioning servers. Alternative: Google Cloud Functions.
- Amazon RDS: Provides scalable and managed relational databases. Alternative: Google Cloud SQL.
- Amazon DynamoDB: Offers fast and predictable performance with seamless scalability. Alternative: Google Cloud Firestore.
- Amazon ElastiCache: Improves application performance by caching. Alternative: Google Memorystore.
- Amazon SQS: Decouples application components for better scalability. Alternative: Google Cloud Pub/Sub.
- Amazon SNS: Sends real-time notifications to users. Alternative: Google Cloud Pub/Sub.
- Amazon CloudWatch: Monitors resources and applications. Alternative: Google Cloud Monitoring.
- AWS X-Ray: Analyzes and debugs production applications. Alternative: Google Cloud Trace.

Scaling Plans
- Horizontal Scaling: Add more EC2 instances and use Auto Scaling to handle increased load.
- Database Sharding: Partition data across multiple databases to distribute the load.
- Caching Strategy: Increase the use of ElastiCache to reduce database load.
- Serverless Architecture: Utilize more AWS Lambda functions to handle specific tasks without managing servers.
- Global Reach: Use AWS Global Accelerator to improve performance for users worldwide.
